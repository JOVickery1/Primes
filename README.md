# Primes
Various python scripts involving prime factorization as well as generating random primes and semi-primes below a certain number.

Programs made for fun and practice. Inspired by reading about Shor's algorithm and RSA encryption.

All programs took a net time of about one afternoon to make.

**Definition of semi-prime:** an integer which is the product of exactly two prime numbers. Some examples are 6 = 2\*3, 91=7\*13, and 9=3\*3

# Explanations of the programs:

**PrimeChecker.py:** takes in an number and determines whether it is prime or not.

**factoring.py and factoring2.py:** take in a number and provide the prime factorization. This is a rudimentary factoring algorithm. The difference between the two is that factoring.py uses the math module and factoring2.py uses numpy

**RandonPrime.py:** takes in a number and then outputs a prime less than that number every time you hit enter.

**RandomPrime2.py:** outputs a random prime number less than 100,000 every time you hit enter.

**RandSemiPrime.py:** takes in a number and then outputs a random semiprime less than that number every time you hit enter.

**RandSemiPrime2.py:** outputs a random semiprime less than 100,000 every time you hit enter.
